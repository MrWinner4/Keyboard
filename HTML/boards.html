            <h1>Board sizes</h1>
            <p> There are many different board sizes for all desks and users. Your most common sizes will be things like TKL(ten keyless) or 75%.
                Most sizes will be in terms of %, referring to the amount of keys compared to a full sized keyboard with a numad and all function keys.
                You can really choose whatever suits your situation and how much desk space you want to take up, but it's recommended to start with the
                two afformentioned most common sizes.

            <h1>PCB's</h1>
            <p> PCB's are what register keypresses and are the "brains" of the keyboard. Most builders don't really have to worry about them much,
                as they will be included in most kits. As you get more advanced, they might become more important, but for right now they likely will not
                be. The only thing most people need to be concerned about are if the PCB is <b>hotswap</b> or not. A PCB being hotswap just means that you
                are able to change out switches very easily without need of soldering. I would not recommend getting a soldered PCB until you don't need
                this website anymore.

        <div class = "section1">
            <h1>Mounting Styles</h1>
            <p> Boards have mounting styles that can affect the sound of the keyboard. A handful of common ones are tray mount(plate and pcb are screwed into case), top mount(plate connects to top frame which connects to bottom frame),
                and gasket mount(bottom frame is connected to top frame with small rubber gaskets cushoning it in the middle). Mounting style completly depends on the board you use, so I recommend going on youtube and seeing how the
                feel and sound are effected by each to find what is right for you.

        <div class = "section2">
            <h1>Extras!</h1>
            <p> Many Keyboards come with extra bells and whistles such as knobs or even LCD screens. Of course, none of these are required and they almost never affect sound, but they can be fun and help quality of life, so if you
                have the budget, go for it.
