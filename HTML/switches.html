            <h1>Membrane Switches</h1>
            <p>There are many types of switches. Most keyboards either have a membrane or mechanical switch. A membrane switch works using
                a rubber dome that inverts when the switch is pressed. It closes an electrical conductive membrane, signaling a key press.
                This provides a working keyboard, but an unsatisfying feel and sound.

            <h1>Mechanical Switches</h1>
            <p> However, there is another alternative. Mechanical switches work using a stem, spring, and a metal crosspoint along with 2 housings
                to keep everything in place. The stem is pressed down until the the crosspoint hits a metal contact in the lower housing, signaling
                a key press. The spring then pushes the stem back up into the upper housing, and the keypress is completed.

            <h1>Clicky vs. Tactile vs. Linear</h1>
            <p> There are 3 main types of mechanical switches: clicky, tactile, and linear. Clicky switches are quite common among non-enthusiasts,
                and it's clicky sound is likely what most people associate mechanical keyboards with. Linear switches are the other end of the spectrum:
                they don't have any bump during the switch press, giving it a smoother feel. Tactile is somewhere in between the two: a small bump that
                isn't super audible but definitely affects the key press. Deciding which switch to go with is crucial in deciding how you want your board to
                sound. PS: usually, enthusiasts prefer tactile and linear. No hate if you like clicky, just letting you know.

            <h1>Cherry and everything else</h1>
            <p> Cherry is a huge manufacturer of switches, with their cherry mx red, brown, and blue switches being the staples of linear, tactile, and clicky switches.
                While their switches are a great starting point, many enthusiasts prefer other companies like gateron or kalih, as they provide a more unique
                sound profile and more ways to change the sound of the keyboard.
