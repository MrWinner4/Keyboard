            <h3>Keyboards are a necessity in the digital age, as conveying thoughts and ideas to others through computers is an integral part
                of modern life. But as much as we use them, keyboards often get overlooked. So what's going on there? And why do some people
                spend way too much money to create their own? This page tries to answer these questions along with tips and info on how to build
                your own.
